# Text_Summarizer

I summarize a sentence using a simple idea. First, I count the frequency of each word in the document given. Then, for each sentence I give it a score according the words in the sentence and how frequent they are. Then, I choose the sentences with the top scores and reorder these sentences in their original ordering.
